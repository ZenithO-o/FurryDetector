# FurryDetector

This is the Furry Detector program as seen on my [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/FurryMemes)!

It uses the Twitter API, TensorFlow, and Tkinter to make an all-in-one furry detecting program.

## Usage

In the file `twitter_key.json` you must put your Twitter API key information in the respective fields.

Read Twitter's tutorial [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api) for getting an API key.

You can then run `main.py` and use the appropriate input fields in the GUI to select the Twitter user,
\# of tweets, and then calculate using the ML model!

**Please be sure to read `requirements.txt` for the modules used**

## Other

Contributions are welcome!

This was not coded the best and has a few issues, so feel free to pull request!

(This was coded by me over a year ago when I had no idea wtf I was doing,
I haven't changed the source code much since then, so good luck with that)
